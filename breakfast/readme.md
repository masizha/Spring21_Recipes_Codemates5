# Balanced Breakfast Burritos

## Servings: 
- 4 burritos

## Time to prepare: 
- 45 minutes

## Ingredients:
- 4 burrito-sized flour tortillas
- 1.5 cups of shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, mozzarella, or whatever you'd like!)
- 1/2 lb. of sausage (Breakfast, spicy, chorizo)
- 4 large eggs
- 1 large avocado (peeled, pitted, and diced up)
- 1/2 to 1/3 cup of tomato salsa
- Vegetable oil or non-stick spray
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon of paprika
- Sour cream (optional)
- Hot sauce (optional)

## Equipment needed:
- Non-stick pan (10" or larger)
- Spatula (Make sure it won't affect the non-stick aspect of pan - a metal spatula may not be the best)
- Slotted spoon
- Knife
- Medium bowls for mixing/ whisking
- Plates

## Steps for preparation:
- Whisk the eggs with paprika and as much salt & pepper to your liking in a medium bowl. Set aside.
- Heat the pan over medium-high heat and add the sausage, using the slotted spoon to break it up. Cook and stir frequently until browned (about 5 minutes). 
- Using the slotted spoon, transfer the cooked sausage to a plate and leave the drippings in the pan.
- Reduce the heat to low/medium low. Add the whisked eggs and scramble them in the pan until cooked (feel free to use the slotted spoon again). Then, transfer the eggs to another plate and wipe down the pan.
- On each flour tortilla, spoon a quarter of the salsa and then had a quarter of your avocado. If you'd like, feel free to add sour cream (but this is optional). Next, add a quarter of the sausage and eggs. Finally, add a quarter of your cheese.
- Now it's time to roll! Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling and tightly roll it while tucking in the edges.
- On medium heat, lightly coat the pan with either oil or nonstick spray. Once the pan is hot, place the burritos in the pan, seam side down. 
- Cover the pan and cook the burrito until the bottom is golden brown (about 3 minutes). Then, flip the burrito over and cover again until golden.
- Once golden brown, the burritos should be served shortly after so they stay warm!


### Notes:
- Feel free to substitute the meat with bacon or breakfast ham (or any other protein you like)!
- You can also add other vegetables (like diced bell peppers) but be sure to be mindful about how many ingredients you have in the burrito; otherwise, it may not roll tightly and could burst.
